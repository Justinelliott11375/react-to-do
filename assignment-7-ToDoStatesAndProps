Why does React only allow information to be passed down in the hierarchy? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach? Discuss this topic with your mentor.
Passing data exclusively downward allows for a single 'source of truth' which makes code more predictable, less complex, and easier to debug. By only allowing data to move down the hierarchy to child components(maintaining a local scope), we can keep components from changing and influencing in ways that we don't want. The disadvantage of this approach is that it requires more "boilerplate" code to be written repeatedly, but again the single "source of truth" allows for easier debugging.
